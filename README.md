# Open-Data-Analytics

Analytics can be categorized at a high level into three distinct types:

Descriptive Analytics, which use data aggregation and data mining to provide insight into the past and answer: “What has happened?”
Predictive Analytics, which use statistical models and forecasts techniques to understand the future and answer: “What could happen?”
Prescriptive Analytics, which use optimization and simulation algorithms to advice on possible outcomes and answer: “What should we do?”
